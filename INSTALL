This package contains setaffil.exe, which is everything you need to get going.
Just copy it wherever you like, and follow the instructions in the README.

Building from source requires a moderately-recent version of the Cygwin
distribution <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>, or alternatively, it
_should_ build using MinGW <http://www.mingw.org>.  MinGW support might
take a little bit of Makefile hacking, but probably not.  The author uses
cygwin, and calls it good at that.

"make" or "make all" or "make setaffin.exe" will build the little blob of
source into a little blob of binary.  Then, since you have a new binary,
see the top paragraph for installation instructions...  ;-)

Oh, and "make clean" does the right thing, too.
